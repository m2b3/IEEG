Fix the project reopen bug in app/main_window.py so that saved channel_groups are restored before rebuilding filtered data from source.
Keep the change minimal and explain exactly what you changed.

## Assistant
Adjusted the project reopen flow in [app/main_window.py](/c:/Users/m2b3m/Documents/EpilepsyTools/I_EEG/app/main_window.py#L871) so `saved_channel_groups` are restored before `_rebuild_active_raw_from_source()` runs.

Exactly what changed:
- Moved `self._restore_channel_groups(saved_channel_groups)` to immediately after the `review` section is parsed and before `_push_scope_profile_to_ui()`, `_rebuild_active_raw_from_source()`, and `_refresh_active_signal_everywhere()`.
- Removed the later duplicate `self._restore_channel_groups(saved_channel_groups)` from the `_restoring_project` block.

This keeps the patch minimal and fixes the reopen bug by ensuring group-specific filters rebuild against the restored macro/micro assignments instead of the temporary default all-macro state.

I verified the change with a local diff; I did not run the GUI.
